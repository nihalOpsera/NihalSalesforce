Real-time healthcare calls for a cloud-capable network
Today’s largest, most complex healthcare systems are handling more data than ever before, pushing current IT operations to their limit. Overcoming the key challenges — scalability, reliability, quality of service and security — requires evolving to a real-time healthcare model.

This new technical and operational model leverages the latest cloud and digital technologies, so clinicians and patients can connect, communicate and collaborate more effectively.

Read our white paper, “Why networks are essential for real-time healthcare &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/17681.networks.for.realtime.healthcare.LP.html]]&gt;”, to understand how to architect the network for the future.
Sincerely,

Cindy Bergevin
