Join this Nokia and IHS Markit webinar &lt;[[https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_9NbDMPK_SReXplg-IWlCcg]]&gt; to discuss the future of emergency response systems.
Today’s emergency response centres face many challenges and their responsibilities are growing. As cases are getting more complex, an emergency response system based on voice only is no longer adequate to meet these intense demands.
Transitioning to a more multimedia-centric approach provides more advanced tools and information for resolving incidents, including rich media, such as videos submitted by the public, IoT, analytics and automation.
These new types of information help first responders increase their situational awareness and solve incidents faster — when every second counts.
This webinar will discuss:


	- Different paths for evolving from legacy 9-1-1 and 112 systems to all-IP based emergency communications systems (NG9-1-1 and NG112)
	- What this transformation means for PSAPs, first responders and citizens, as well as society
	- How different regions are progressing when it comes to emergency communications services modernization


Webinar participants will be the first ones gaining access to a brand-new white paper examining the above topics in more detail, with steps toward future-proofing your emergency response.
