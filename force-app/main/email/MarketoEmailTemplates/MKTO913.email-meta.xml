Healthcare cloud infrastructure: SDN and network virtualization
Digital transformation is a growing business imperative for healthcare providers, and cloud computing is a critical element in your digital transformation strategy. As private-hybrid cloud models are essential for a secure and scalable transformation, the focus turns to the network in the data center, between data centers, and across the wide area network.

Read IDC’s Technology Spotlight, “SDN and Network Virtualization &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/2220.Gamechanger.IDC.Spotlight.html]]&gt;”, to learn the network is critical for your digital transformation.
Sincerely,

Cindy Bergevin
 Head of Healthcare Marketing, Nokia
