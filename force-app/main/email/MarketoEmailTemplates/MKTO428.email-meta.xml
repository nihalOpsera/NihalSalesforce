Transforming healthcare IT with cloud and SDN
With cloud being a critical element for IT in the digital transformation of the healthcare system, software-defined networking SDN grows in importance across the network. SDN supports cloud and provides an agile, flexible foundation for digital transformation.

As UPMC, a world-renowned healthcare provider, moved to a cloud IT model, they implemented server virtualization that resulted in network bottlenecks affecting responsiveness to applications and network performance.

Read our case study &quot;UPMC boosts application deployment speed with SDN &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/rs/937-WRZ-618/images/UPMC%20boosts%20virtualized%20application%20deployment%20speed%20with%20SDN.pdf]]&gt;“ and learn how UPMC implemented SDN from Nokia’s Nuage Networks and resolved network bottlenecks and utilized existing network resources more efficiently.
Sincerely,
