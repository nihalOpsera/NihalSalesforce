Partner Portal release 3.1 changes
Partners,

In our continuing efforts to improve Nokia Partner satisfaction and streamline our sales operations, Nokia will bring further enhancements to the Nokia Partner Portal with a new deployment on 26th February. Nokia continuously strives for a best in class partner experience to support your self-sufficiency and revenue acceleration.

There are no changes to the roles that partner users play in the system. There are however, a few important process and tool related topics to be aware of.

Document Management (new approach – preparation prior to 26th Feb deployment!)


Today, the Partner Personal Spaces are not integrated with the Partner Portal and are complex to maintain. With the introduction of the Library capability in the Partner Portal, we are now able to provide better document sharing capabilities in a single “one stop shop”.
 The folders (and all content) within your Personal spaces will be migrated to a Sales Force document storage system called “Libraries”. All of your folders and files will be migrated *AS IS* into the Portal.
 As with existing Personal Spaces, there are different levels of permission to read/write/download content with SFDC Libraries. Partner Relationship Managers (partners serving as administrators) will be able to request access for the users at their Partner company. Upon migration, permissions will be assigned in the new libraries exactly the same as they are assigned in the existing Personal Spaces, i.e., Publishers will remain publishers and read only access will remain read only.
 Do I have to do anything right now?
 No. You do not have to take action. BUT, IF you would like to clean or archive the data in the personal spaces, please do so before the close of business Monday, 29th January in your timezone. Migration will be finalized by the new release deployment on 26th February.
