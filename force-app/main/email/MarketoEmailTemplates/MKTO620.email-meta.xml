SUCCESSFUL cloud implementations reveal best practices
Hi {{lead.First Name:default=Sir/Madam}},

Leverage what others have learned on the road to a successful unification cloud and avoid all the drawbacks from the new architecture development process.

Read the use case “Unification cloud for large enterprises &lt;[[https://pages.nokia.com/T001XT_Unification.Cloud.LargeEnterprise.LP.html?did=d000000000b1&amp;utm_campaign=gamechanger&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=email 11a-unificationcloudforLEusecase&amp;utm_term=general]]&gt;” to learn how the Nokia overlay cloud solution has been successfully applied across multiple implementations and how you can:


	- Unify and simplify even a large enterprise environment arising from mergers and acquisitions into a coherent cloud
	- Get mission-critical network control and security
	- Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by at least 25 percent!


I hope that you enjoy this use case!
