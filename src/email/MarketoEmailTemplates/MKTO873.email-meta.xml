Mission-Critical Broadband – The Mobile Network Operator’s Vital Role
Many governments around the globe are seeking to take advantage of mobile broadband technologies to improve the capabilities of emergency services communications. Several deployment models exist in which mobile network operators (MNO) and governments are partnering to provide network services and applications that will help meet the increasing demand to give first responders better situational awareness and improved responsiveness.

 In this webinar, AT&amp;T, CritComm Insights and Nokia examine the opportunity as well as the challenges around the delivery of mission-critical communications.
