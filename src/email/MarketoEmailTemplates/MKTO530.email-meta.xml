Accreditation deadline approaching
March 27, 2018

 Dear Partner, 

 I am emailing to remind you that the deadline of May 4, 2018 is approaching for your company to meet all criteria for Partner Program Product Accreditation at your current level. You will want to pay attention to this deadline if your company wishes to continue the rights and entitlements afforded to you as a result of your Product Accreditation tier, such as pricing discounts. 

 As a reminder, Nokia requires any partner who was contracted under Nokia Partner Program PPA-RES as of May 4, 2017, and who has committed to become Accredited at the Advanced or Expert tier, to meet all the published criteria to fully achieve and/or maintain that Accreditation tier. Detailed Program Rules relating to Accreditation may be found in the Partner Portal in Section 6.5b of the Partner Program Rules. A brief list of the requirements by tier and product can be found below.

 If you have any questions related to this upcoming deadline or your current accreditation status, please contact your Partner Sales Manager.

 Regards,

 Jerome Jullien
 Vice President, Nokia Global Partner Program
