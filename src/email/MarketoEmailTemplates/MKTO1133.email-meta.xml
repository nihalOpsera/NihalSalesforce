Dear {{lead.First Name:default=customer}},

Nokia would like to invite you to join us at World ATM Congress 2019, March 12-14, in Madrid, Spain.

Ambitious strategies and performance targets set by ICAO as part of the Aviation System Block Upgrades (ASBU) framework and global Communication Navigation and Surveillance plans have created a string of challenges for ANSPs globally. A key challenge is the continued support of legacy applications and services during the required move to the IP network environment addressed in the framework.

At our stand #891, Nokia will demonstrate innovative technologies for mission-critical domestic, airport and international networking as well as managed service options that can help ANSPs meet these challenges and more. We will also showcase the latest drone and air-to-ground innovations designed to address the unique needs of ANSPs.
