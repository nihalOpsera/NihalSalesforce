    <formula>&apos;License Points are required for each device managed by NFM-P - you need to buy the right number of License Points to enable management of all devices. This tool will automatically calculate the number of License Points required for the hardware you have already added to the shopping cart (and HA/DR License Points if selected on the Platform Tab.). Please contact Nokia Sales if you are unsure how to calculate additional license points for any other equipment that you would like NFM-P to manage.&apos;</formula>
